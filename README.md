The player 1 is always the first to be able to roll.

There's three buttons:
  - New Game: resets entirely the game.
  - Roll Dice: rolls the dice and adds up the numeric value to the current block, stacking it.
  - Hold: keep points safely and switches player turn.

If the player rolls and appears the dice with 1 dot, it deletes all the stacking points and inmediately switches player turn.

When one player holds and hits more or equal 100 points, the game stops and indicates that this player won!
You won't be able to do anything, until you play another game by pressing the "New Game" button.
